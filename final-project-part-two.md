# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# Identified changes for Part III

## Findings, insights and plans in how to modify the project
Based on the responses from the three individuals regarding the housing costs in China, the key findings suggest a universal recognition of the high housing market prices and their broader implications. These insights lead to the adjustments for future discussions. 

All interviewees, regardless of age or profession, acknowledge the high housing prices in China, indicating that this issue is widely recognized across different demographics. The high cost of housing is not just a financial burden but also a source of economic strain that affects personal and professional decisions, particularly for younger generations.

### **Modifications for Future Content:**
1. **Shift Focus to Economic and Societal Impacts:** While acknowledging the high prices, it's essential to delve deeper into the economic fallout and societal effects. This includes exploring how the housing market affects consumer spending, savings rates, and investment behaviors.
2. **Highlight Impact on Family Planning:** Given the mention of housing costs affecting intentions to have babies, future discussions should emphasize the correlation between housing affordability and demographic trends alone side the current the fertility rate plot. This could involve analyzing policies that might mitigate these effects and exploring case studies from other countries with similar challenges.
3. **Examine Long-term Economic Sustainability:** Explore the long-term sustainability of the current housing market trends, including potential risks to economic stability, such as the creation of a housing bubble and its implications for the financial system.
4. **Policy and Solution-Focused Discussions:** Shift towards discussing potential policy solutions and innovative approaches to address the housing affordability crisis. This could include examining successful international models, proposing reforms in housing policy, urban planning, and financial regulation to improve accessibility and affordability.
