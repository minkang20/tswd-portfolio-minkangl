# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

### Target Audience and Approach

The target audience encompasses a diverse group, primarily focusing on policymakers, investors, and individuals deeply invested in public welfare. This project casts a wide net, recognizing that many within our society are potential stakeholders in the discourse surrounding housing market policy. Whether it's through casting a vote, participating in public initiatives, or contributing to the broader conversation, their involvement is crucial.

To capture a comprehensive perspective, I have carefully selected individuals from varied backgrounds, encompassing differences in occupation, age, gender, and more. This approach ensures that our insights reflect the multifaceted impact of housing policies and market dynamics.

### **Goals for the Interview:**

1. **Assess Current Knowledge:** Determine the respondent's level of understanding regarding housing market trends, prices, and fertility patterns.
2. **Explore Opinions on Socio-Economic Impacts:** Understand the respondent's views on the relationship between housing costs and social issues, including economic crisis and fertility rates.
3. **Gauge Interest in Change:** Identify the level of interest and readiness among respondents to support or initiate changes in housing market policies or investment strategies.
4. **Inform and Persuade:** Discover effective communication strategies that resonate with this audience, focusing on the precision of information and compelling narratives to drive action.
