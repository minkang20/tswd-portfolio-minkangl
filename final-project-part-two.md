# Data visualization project: People Pay More Than Just House Prices

# Wireframes / storyboards
[Shorthand storyboard link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-price-of-houses-is-more-than-expected/index.html)

This work explores the significant impact of skyrocketing house prices in China, delving into the socioeconomic and personal ramifications. It outlines how rapid urbanization, speculative investment, and lagging policies have led to a housing affordability crisis, particularly in mega-cities like Beijing and Shanghai. This crisis not only places financial strain on individuals but also contributes to wider economic and societal issues, including a housing bubble risk with major developers like Evergrande facing debt default, and a declining fertility rate as the cost of living inhibits family growth. The narrative emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to address housing affordability, suggesting that the path forward should aim to make homeownership accessible to all, thereby fostering stronger, more inclusive communities. Through detailed analysis and calls to action, the piece argues for a reimagined approach to housing that prioritizes affordability, equity, and stability.

# Identified changes for Part III

### Findings, insights and plans in how to modify the project
Based on the responses from the three individuals regarding the housing costs in China, the key findings suggest a universal recognition of the high housing market prices and their broader implications. These insights lead to the adjustments for future discussions. 

All interviewees, regardless of age or profession, acknowledge the high housing prices in China, indicating that this issue is widely recognized across different demographics. The high cost of housing is not just a financial burden but also a source of economic strain that affects personal and professional decisions, particularly for younger generations.

2. **Highlight Impact on Family Planning:** Given the mention of housing costs affecting intentions to have babies, future discussions should emphasize the correlation between housing affordability and demographic trends alone side the current the fertility rate plot. This could involve analyzing policies that might mitigate these effects and exploring case studies from other countries with similar challenges.
