> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

This project aims to provide a comprehensive visualization of the housing bubble and its consequential impact on demographic trends. Housing costs, an essential aspect of living, have escalated to levels that appear unsustainable when contrasted with average income levels across numerous markets. This disparity raises concerns about its broader implications on both the economy and society at large.

A key metric in evaluating housing affordability is the housing-to-income ratio, which offers insights into whether housing costs are disproportionately high relative to people's earnings. It is posited that the burden of elevated housing expenses plays a significant role in influencing key life decisions, including family planning and migration patterns. The work of North Douglas supports this assertion, highlighting how the cost of housing is a critical factor driving these personal and demographic shifts.

To address these challenges, this project will delve into the dynamics of the housing market, examining the intricate relationship between housing affordability and its effects on population movements and growth. By leveraging data on the housing-to-income ratio alongside demographic trends, I aim to uncover the nuanced ways in which the housing bubble influences decisions on migration and family expansion.

The analysis will not only shed light on the current state of the housing market but also offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and individuals alike, seeking to understand and navigate the complexities of housing affordability. Through this exploration, I aspire to contribute to a more informed dialogue on sustainable housing policies and practices that can support balanced economic and social development.

>- story arc

Embarking on a narrative journey that explores the intricate relationship between housing costs, migration, and fertility rates, I begin with an intriguing statistic or question that piques curiosity, setting the stage for a deeper exploration. Through the lens of compelling personal stories, we build empathy, connecting the audience to the individuals directly impacted by these issues. This emotional groundwork leads to a moment of enlightenment, as we present concise visualizations and analyses that illuminate the complexities at play. Reflecting on the broader implications, we provoke thoughtful concern about the future, guiding the audience towards a resolution that inspires hope. By showcasing actionable solutions and success stories, we aim to motivate positive change, concluding with an optimistic message about the collective power of informed action to address global challenges, weaving a cohesive narrative that engages, educates, and empowers.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

For the initial phase of our analysis on the relationship between housing costs and immigration, we leverage data from reputable institutions, including governmental bodies and globally recognized organizations. This approach ensures accuracy and reliability. Below is a polished description of the data sources utilized, along with brief descriptions:

Official Census and Statistics Departments of Each Country/Region: These are primary sources for accurate and up-to-date demographic, economic, and social statistics. Each country's statistics office collects data through censuses, surveys, and other research methods, offering insights into housing, population dynamics, and immigration trends. This data is authoritative, as it is collected and published by national governments, ensuring high standards of reliability and comprehensiveness.

Our World in Data: A project of the Global Change Data Lab, a registered charity in England and Wales, Our World in Data presents research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems. It compiles and curates data from various sources, including international organizations, academic institutions, and government bodies, making it a valuable resource for global trends in economics, environmental science, health, and technology. The platform is known for its rigorous data documentation and accessibility, making complex issues understandable through data visualization.

Numbeo: Numbeo is the world’s largest database of user-contributed data about cities and countries worldwide. It provides current information on cost of living, housing indicators, perceived crime rates, and quality of healthcare, among other statistics. The data on Numbeo is generated by its users and gives a grassroots view of living conditions, including comparative housing costs across different regions. While it may not have the same level of official sanction as government data, Numbeo's broad user base contributes to a diverse and comprehensive dataset that is useful for comparing everyday living expenses.

Utilizing these data sources, we aim to establish a foundational understanding of the relationship between housing costs and immigration patterns, ensuring our analysis is grounded in credible and diverse datasets. This multifaceted approach allows for a robust examination of how housing affordability and availability influence migration decisions on a global scale.

Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

Bar Charts: I will present the countries' ratios of housing costs to income, along with their immigration and fertility rates, in a clear and orderly manner. This approach will highlight the relationship between housing affordability and demographic trends.

Line Plots: By employing two distinct lines—one representing housing costs and the other fertility rates—we offer an intuitive means for the audience to grasp the initial relationship between these variables. This visualization facilitates an easy comparison over time.

Geographical Heat Maps: To illustrate the spatial distribution of housing costs, migration patterns, and fertility rates, I will employ heat maps. These maps will showcase regional variations, enabling a detailed comparative analysis of how different areas are impacted by, or contribute to, these factors. Utilizing country codes will streamline this process, making it straightforward to implement in Tableau or Python.
