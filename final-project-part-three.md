# Changes made since Part II
Following feedback from interviews and further reflection, I implemented several adjustments to enhance the project:

- I updated the visual elements, transitioning to a predominantly black color scheme and replacing images to ensure a consistent style that reflects the gravity of the subject. I now exclusively use images from Unsplash that are free from copyright restrictions.
- The content distribution has been recalibrated to de-emphasize the historical surge in housing prices, focusing more on the current high costs in comparison to other countries and the associated consequences.
- Initial feedback highlighted the compelling nature of the data presentation and narrative flow. To address desires for a more balanced discussion on high housing costs and policy responses, I've enriched the content with actionable insights sourced from reputable academic and journalistic outlets (such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal). This addition aims to captivate our primary audience, who are well-versed in the political and economic underpinnings of housing policies.
- The design of the data visualizations has been refined to include a reference line marking the introduction of new government policies, enabling an analysis of their impact on fertility rates.

## The audience
The project aims to engage policymakers, investors, and a broader audience interested in housing policy and the Chinese economy. Through the feedback process, I recognized the value in expanding our intended audience, acknowledging that a wide range of individuals can contribute to the discourse.

Persona (a target audience case): 

Mr. Li exemplifies a key segment of our audience from the governmental sector, seeking to navigate urban and housing challenges. His interaction with the project is driven by a quest for deep insights into policy formulation and development.
