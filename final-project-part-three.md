# The Price of House is More Than Expected

## The final data story

My work examines the profound effects of escalating housing prices in China, focusing on the socioeconomic and personal consequences that have emerged. It highlights how rapid urbanization, speculative investment, and inadequate policy responses have precipitated a housing affordability crisis, with pronounced effects in mega-cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. This crisis not only imposes financial burdens on individuals but also contributes to broader economic and societal challenges. These include the risk of a housing bubble, exemplified by major developers like Evergrande facing the threat of debt default, and a declining fertility rate, as the rising cost of living dampens the desire for family expansion. The narrative underscores the critical need for comprehensive reforms aimed at improving housing affordability. It advocates for initiatives to ensure homeownership is within reach for everyone, thus nurturing stronger and more inclusive communities. Among the recommended measures are the provision of public housing similar to Singapore's model, restructuring of debt, and reform of municipal financing mechanisms.

## Changes made since Part II
Following feedback from interviews and further reflection, I implemented several adjustments to enhance the project:

- I updated the visual elements, transitioning to a predominantly black color scheme and replacing images to ensure a consistent style that reflects the gravity of the subject. I now exclusively use images from Unsplash that are free from copyright restrictions.
- The content distribution has been recalibrated to de-emphasize the historical surge in housing prices, focusing more on the current high costs in comparison to other countries and the associated consequences.
- Initial feedback highlighted the compelling nature of the data presentation and narrative flow. To address desires for a more balanced discussion on high housing costs and policy responses, I've enriched the content with actionable insights sourced from reputable academic and journalistic outlets (such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal). This addition aims to captivate our primary audience, who are well-versed in the political and economic underpinnings of housing policies.
- The design of the data visualizations has been refined to include a reference line marking the introduction of new government policies, enabling an analysis of their impact on fertility rates. I aslo added a reference line marking the cut in the interest rate to help explain the house prices spike around 2016.  

## The audience
The project aims to engage policymakers, investors, and a broader audience interested in housing policy and the Chinese economy. Through the feedback process, I recognized the value in expanding our intended audience, acknowledging that a wide range of individuals can contribute to the discourse.

Persona (a target audience case): 

Mr. Li exemplifies a key segment of our audience from the governmental sector, seeking to navigate urban and housing challenges. His interaction with the project is driven by a quest for deep insights into policy formulation and development.

## Final thoughts

This journal presents a fascinating opportunity for me to deeply reconsider facts, persuasively advocate for change, and refine my perspectives. 

During presentations, however, I find it challenging to comprehensively detail the call to action. Moreover, elucidating significant trends in data visualizations, such as the marked escalation in housing prices circa 2016, proves to be complex. While emphasizing key factors could seem advantageous, this method may not capture the intricacies of events within an expansive political and economic landscape. To mitigate this, I integrated a reference line indicating the interest rate reduction, aiming to provide some explanation.

To depict the economic fallout of the housing bubble, I utilize bubble charts that display major real estate firms and their sales data. These charts excel in conveying a more tangible and intuitive grasp of the information, offering a unique lens through which to view the economic impact.
