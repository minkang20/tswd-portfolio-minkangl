# Portfolio

# What I hope to learn
I would like learn how to transform data into insightful, engaging stories, making complex information accessible and impactful. As I prepare for a career in data science, I am dedicated to continuously developing my visualization abilities through practical projects and ongoing lectures.

I am currently on an exciting journey towards becoming a data scientist after guraduation. With a foundational understanding of tools like Python and an eagerness to delve into more advanced platforms like Tableau, I am actively enhancing my skills in creating clear and effective visual narratives.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="me.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.
