# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. I hope you will find something fun here. Enjoy!

# About me
Hi! I'm Minkang Li (He/his/him). I'm a second-year PPM stydent and an incoming data Scientist with a knack for dissecting real-world challenges, crafting predictive models, and delivering actionable insights. In my free time, I like hiking, footballing and photography. I'm more than welcomre to make a connection with you!

# What I hope to learn
I would like learn how to transform data into insightful, engaging stories, making complex information accessible and impactful. As I prepare for a career in data science, I am dedicated to continuously developing my visualization abilities through practical projects and ongoing lectures.

I am currently on an exciting journey towards becoming a data scientist after guraduation. With a foundational understanding of tools like Python and an eagerness to delve into more advanced platforms like Tableau, I am actively enhancing my skills in creating clear and effective visual narratives. 

List: 
1. principles of data visualization
2. tools such as tableau
3. real world applications and projects experience
4. Anything interesting  

# Portfolio
Below is a collection of my data visualization works. 

### Government debt breakdown: [visualizing debt](visualizing-government-debt)
I visualize the government debt breakdown in this work. 

### Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
I made some critique and redesign in this work.

### Final project
My work examines the profound effects of escalating housing prices in China, focusing on the socioeconomic and personal consequences that have emerged. It highlights how rapid urbanization, speculative investment, and inadequate policy responses have precipitated a housing affordability crisis, with pronounced effects in mega-cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. This crisis not only imposes financial burdens on individuals but also contributes to broader economic and societal challenges. These include the risk of a housing bubble, exemplified by major developers like Evergrande facing the threat of debt default, and a declining fertility rate, as the rising cost of living dampens the desire for family expansion. The narrative underscores the critical need for comprehensive reforms aimed at improving housing affordability. It advocates for initiatives to ensure homeownership is within reach for everyone, thus nurturing stronger and more inclusive communities. Among the recommended measures are the provision of public housing similar to Singapore's model, restructuring of debt, and reform of municipal financing mechanisms.

[Part I](final-project-part-one)
Part I is about the story plot, data sources and data visualization sketches.

[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part II provides an initial version of the story and user research results. 

[Part III](final-project-part-two)
Part III presents the final published story and some reflection. 

Thank you! Best.
